# ozone_co_modeling
South Korea : 1km*1km grid ozone, no2 and co modeling from 2002 to 2020 <br>

Prediction results are not the final one. We are trying to improve the accuracy of our model.<br>
After finishing model training, i will update the example codes and results.

## about coding
I preprocessed the data by using Google Earth Engine (javascript base), R and python. <br>
Modeling work is also carried out by R and python. <br>

I shared the example code of Google Earth Engine on my github, so you can see how i extracted the features from Google Earth Engine roughly.<br>
Actually, this is just example code so we adjusted different shape file we made.<br><br>
